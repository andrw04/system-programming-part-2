Programming is the process of creating instructions that tell a computer
how to perform a task. It involves designing algorithms, writing code in
a programming language, and testing and debugging programs to ensure they
work correctly. Programmers use their creativity and problem-solving
skills to develop software applications, games, and other digital tools
that help make our lives easier and more efficient. Learning to program
can open up a world of opportunities in the field of technology and enable
you to bring your ideas to life in the digital world.
